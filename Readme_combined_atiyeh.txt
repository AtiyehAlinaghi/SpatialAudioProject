% not the 'strong' peak.
% However, you can chaneg it to generated a new JSON file. 

% In this combined method the early part of the SIRR after extraction of the non-diffuse energy is added to the 
  late reverberation regenerated by RSAO. However, the drawback is that, there is a linear rising energy in the 
  first part of the RSAO late reverb which will be add up to the early part energy. 

% To solve this problem, I suggest instead of linearly rising energy for the first part of reverberation, we apply 
a Gaussian rising curve which increases very slowly at the beginning and then sharply at the end. We can adjust 
the parameters of the Gaussian curve to achieve the best performance based on the energy in the early reflections. 
The main benefit is that it increases smoothly, avoiding discontinuity.

% We could measure the energy of the diffuse part before the Tmix and set the variance and other parameters of 
the Gaussian curve in a way that it conveys the same energy.
